Installation
============

It is **highly recommended** to use a python environment manager like Poetry (https://python-poetry.org/docs/) to install BioCompose.

To install `bsvs`, you can use pip:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install bsvs

If you are installing from source, clone the repository and use the following commands:

.. code-block:: bash

   git clone https://github.com/biosimulators/bsvs.git
   cd bsvs
   pip install .
